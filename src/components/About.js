                    Passionate about data and driven by cost efficiency and sustainability! With a bachelor’s in Computer Science, I thrive on turning messy, raw data into polished, actionable stories. My strength lies in meticulous data cleaning, wrangling, and preparation—building organized, reliable datasets that form the backbone of impactful analysis. Using tools like Power BI and ArcGIS, I help visualize trends and streamline workflows, while applying a foundational understanding of machine learning to support—not replace—human-driven insights.

Whether it’s refining datasets for accuracy or crafting dashboards that highlight green tech opportunities, I’m committed to supporting the sustainability movement through clarity, not complexity. Let’s work together to transform data into a roadmap for a greener future—one clean spreadsheet at a time! </p>
