                    I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for renewables and green
                    tech! Armed with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a New
                    Zealand Certificate in Information Technology (Level 5), I have
                    experience utilizing Machine Learning, Power BI, and ArcGIS to
                    extract valuable insights from complex datasets. From SWOT
                    analysis to collecting B2B leads, I'm eager to put my skills to
                    work in support of the sustainability movement. Let's collaborate
                    on data-driven solutions to help make the world a greener place!
